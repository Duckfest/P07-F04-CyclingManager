# P07-F04-CyclingManager

Disclaimer -  This game is not created by a professional. Any attempt to compare this product to professional standards will be considered both unfair and annoying. 

F01 First draft 
After spending many hours of research on everything I had zero tangible results.  
Getting started with navigation structure, very basic UI, reading data from script and use in GameObjects. 
Overall terrible result.

 F02 Toying with drag & drop interface 
 'Basic' tab is my first attempt at creating a drag and drop interface (based on simple inventory systems)
 'ProgramsTest' is a proof of concept to see if I can spawn slots triggered by placement if an item

 F03 my first race screen
 Starting with a prepopulated peloton, player can hover over riders and get info panel updated. 
 On 'Race Next Segment Button' a simple algorythm runs to check for each rider their likelyness to fall.  In case of a crash current rider moves over to other object.  (malfunctioning) Textbox scroller publishes results of events.
 First time it starts to feel a tiny bit like a game and ideas start to emerge about possible next steps.
